# Library-Management-System-in-C
# First Semester PF Project — C Language

This repository contains my first semester Programming Fundamentals project, built completely in C language as part of my BSCS coursework.
It marks the beginning of my programming journey and reflects the foundational concepts I learned including loops, functions, conditionals, and user interaction.

# Project Overview

This is a menu-driven console application that allows users to perform different operations based on input.
The program demonstrates:

User input handling
Control structures
Modular programming
Logical decision-making
Error handling and validation

# Features

✔️ Interactive menu system
✔️ Input validation to avoid invalid values
✔️ Modular structure using functions
✔️ Loop-based execution (runs until user chooses to exit)
✔️ Organized and readable code with comments

# Technologies Used
Tool / Language	Purpose
C Language	Core programming language used
GCC / MingW / Turbo C / CodeBlocks (optional)	Compiling and running the code

(Feel free to update compiler name based on what you used)

# How to Run

Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<repo-name>.git

Navigate to the folder:
cd <repo-name>

Compile the program:
gcc main.c -o program

Run:
./program

# Concepts Practiced

Variables and Data Types

If-Else Conditions & Switch Statements

Loops (for, while, do-while)

Functions and modular code

Input/output formatting

Debugging & testing

# Learning Outcome

This project helped me:

Understand how programming logic works

Improve debugging and problem-solving skills

Learn structured programming in C

Gain confidence in writing functional programs

# Future Improvements

🔹 Improve UI formatting
🔹 Add more modules and complexity
🔹 Convert into an advanced version in future semesters

# Contribution

This is a beginner-level academic project, but feedback, suggestions, or improvements are welcome!
